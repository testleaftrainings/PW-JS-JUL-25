📑 Agenda for Week 7 Day 2: OOPs in Framework

🎯 Focus: Mastering Object-Oriented Programming Concepts in TypeScript

📆 31st Aug, Sunday

🕝 Session Highlights

⿡ Recap
Quick review of previous learnings.

⿢Inheritance
Exploring the concept of inheritance for code reuse.
Examples: Implementing single and multilevel inheritance.

⿣ Abstraction
Using abstract classes and methods to define templates.
Examples: Designing partially implemented base classes.

⏸ \[Break / Practice]

⿤Polymorphism
Understanding method overriding and runtime behavior.
Examples: Creating multiple forms of behavior from a single interface.

⿥POM (Page Object Model)
Design pattern to enhance test maintainability and reusability.
Examples: Creating page classes and using them in test cases.


Inheritance :

1. Single Inheritance :

classA{}
classB extends A{}

2. Multilevel Inheritance :

class A{}

class B extends A{}
class C extends B{}

3. Hierarchical inheritance 

class A{}

class B extends A{}
class C extends A{}

4. Hybrid Inheritance

A combination of two or more types of inheritnace (e.x : multilevel and Hierarchical)


5. Multiple Inheritance
Typescript does not support multiple inheritnace using classes.
Can be achieved through interface.

Creating thr lead using 6 pages:

login --> welcome page --> homePage-->LeadPage --> createLead--> viewLead
                                               --> findLead --> viewLead--> edit
                                              ---> mergeLead

                                    -->AccountPage-->createAccount--> viewAccount


login--> username, password, login
welcomePage --> crmsfa, logout
homePage --> leads, accounts,contact, opportunities....
LeadPage --> createLead, findLead

1. Interface :

- Complete hiding of the implemented.
- 100% abstraction.
- Only unimplemented methods.

Summarize 

- class extends another class
- abstract extends another abstract class
- interface extends another interface
- class extends abstract class
- class implements interface
- class extends abstract class im plemnets interface

We cannot see implementation of your page fixture, context browser in playwright everytging is put in as interface

2. Abstraction 

abstract class :

- 0 to 100% abstraction.
- Method signature --> unimplementedmethods
- Implemented methods --> logic 

Example :

clickLogin()
