Sample Dropdown of ecommerce website :
------------------------------------

<select id="category-filter">
  <option value="101"> Electronics</option> 0
  <option value="102"> Books</option>       1
  <option value="103"> Bags</option>        2
  <option value="104"> Clothes</option>     3


1. Select By Value :
-Stable and less likely to change since the value is often connected to your backend

2. Select By Label :
Tend to change due to business requirements / geography
Example travel name of places in your website

3. Select BY Index :
When ever there is not change in the order of your dropdown can go for select by index 

Non-select tags
---------------
1. Locate your dropdown and use click()/ enter the value
2. locate the particular option from the dropdownlist - clickit

Assertions :
-----------

1. Generic Assertion.

Assertions on variables or values, not directly tied to UI elements.

toHaveValue()
toHaveText()
toContainText()

2. Locator Assertion.
Assertions performed on UI elements indentified using locators

toBeVisible()
toBeEnabled()
toBeEditable()

3. Page Assertion.

Assertions made on the page object , such as URL and title.

toHaveURL(url)
toHaveTitle()

4. Snapshot Assertions.
Assertions comparing two visual elments from the UI particular

5. API refernce Assertions.
Assertions used check your API reponses 


Based on Functionality 
--------------------

1. Auto retry
2. Non-retry assetion


Hard Assertion.
Soft Assertion.








Ways of handling dropdown:
----------------------------

| Method     | Stability | Readability | Use When...                         |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| By value |   High    |   Low       | Most reliable, backend-driven IDs   |
| By label |   Medium  |   High      | UI is stable or for quick checks    |
| By index |   Low     |   Low       | Only if no other way /staticorder¬†|







Arrays :
--------

1. Dynamic size
2. Heterogenous elements.
