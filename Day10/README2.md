## Hooks

### Overview
- Hooks are special methods in Playwright that are used to set up and tear down test environments.

### Types of Hooks
- **`beforeAll`**: Runs once before all tests in a file.
- **`afterAll`**: Runs once after all tests in a file.
- **`beforeEach`**: Runs before each test.
- **`afterEach`**: Runs after each test.

### Use Cases
- **Setup/Teardown**: Use hooks to initialize and clean up resources (e.g., launching browsers, closing databases).
- **Data Preparation**: Use hooks to prepare test data or reset application state before each test.
