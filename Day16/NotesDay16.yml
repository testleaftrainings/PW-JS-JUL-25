Definition of Codegen in Playwright

- In Playwright, Codegen is a tool that automatically generates test scripts by recording your actions in the browser.
- It helps beginners quickly create tests without writing code manually.
- You perform actions (click, type, navigate), and Playwright generates the corresponding code (in JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C#, or Java).
- Itâ€™s useful for learning locators and bootstrapping test cases.
